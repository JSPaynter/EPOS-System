# EPOS-System
EPOS system for restaurants, that communicates through Android, Java, JSP, and SQL on an Oracle Database.
This is an on going project during my final year at university.

The system is designed to be scalable with any size resturant, and help reduce the work load on staff, along with helping to avoid certain human errors that can have dramatic consequences. The software allows staff to use a Java based application to view and edit current tables, while also allowing managers to access more features such as creating there meals to be dynamically added to the menu, and also generate orders for them, based on sales. The system also has a android application for tablets, which will allow customers to place there own order into the system and see the details associated with it.

Both of these application communicate to an Oracle database through JSP pages, so bring some work away from the applications and help improve secruity with the connection. This also allows easier management if some key details changed in the database.
